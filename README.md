# Infrequent-metadynamics

First step:

Run infrequent metadynamics using the `plumed.dat` file. The basic idea of infrequent metadynamics is that the transition state along CV should be bias free. Please see https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/ct500040r for theoretical description of the method.

In our case we will use $\chi_1$ and $\chi_2$ angle of Tyrosine as CV. Our aim is to calculate transition time associated with **normal** to **flip** transition as shown in the following picture.
